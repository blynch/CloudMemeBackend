CloudMemeBackend
================

Example from the End To End Tour Session at Google Cloud Platform Live (https://cloud.google.com/events/google-cloud-platform-live/). 

This example shows how to build a simple Meme application that uses MongoDB as a backend and provides an Endpoints front end for a mobile client. 

Feel free to use this sample for building your own App Engine application on the Google Cloud Platform.
